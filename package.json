It is inspired by early/mid-aughts fan sites (often hosted on AngelFire or Geocities). These sites were made for no reason other than to express the pure joy of the fan, often created by teenagers with nothing but a passion for their subject and a copy of \"HTML for Dummies\". In my opinion, an example of 21st c. folk art. Functionalities will include: a blog with the option to leave comments, a gallery, music and/or video page, and (hopefully) a Dollz maker. ## ERD, Component Hierarchy Diagram, and Trello Board [Backend ERD](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/d7396ff7-9e4c-4a92-af7e-645aeba4ee45/edit?invitationId=inv_c7041a1c-dc69-484d-80b4-2c61da23629f)",
